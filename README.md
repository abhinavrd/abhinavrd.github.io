## नमस्कार | Namaskāra | Hello

Welcome to my page! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with Prof. <a href="https://www.unr.edu/me/people/james-hanna" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">James Hanna</a> at the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/me/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">University of Nevada, Reno</a>. I did my Ph.D. and M.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering with Profs. <a href="https://ishans.in" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Ishan Sharma</a> and <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ssgupta" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Shakti S. Gupta</a> at the IIT Kanpur, India. My <a href="#research" style="text-decoration:none">research</a> interest is Applied Mechanics, especially dynamics and stability of flexible structures. Flexible structures, particularly cables, which are subjected to aero/hydrodynamic loading find many applications in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering. During my graduate studies, I have taken <a href="#course" style="text-decoration:none">courses</a> in Mechanics and Mathematics and developed a scientific attitude to research. This webpage gives a brief overview of the different kinds of problems I am like to work on.

In my <a href="#sloshing" style="text-decoration:none">M.Tech</a>, I did theoretical modeling and experiments of <a href="#sloshing" style="text-decoration:none">fuel sloshing</a> in spacecraft. It was an inverse problem in rigid-body dynamics. Our model established, to some extent, the relation between the fuel remaining and the deviation of spacecraft’s attitudinal motion from its predicted rigid-body motion. During my Ph.D., I worked on the following two problems concerning the dynamics of cables which are subjected to aero/hydrodynamic loads. Initially, I did theoretical modeling of a <a href="#traveling" style="text-decoration:none">traveling ﬂexible cable</a> and solved its governing equation using Spectral Element (SE), as well as Finite Element (FE) techniques. This problem was in the context of the stability of tethered aerostats (blimps). Later in my Ph.D., I worked on the dynamics of a <a href="#towing" style="text-decoration:none">ﬂexible cable towing</a> an underslung load beneath a helicopter. Here the cable was modeled using the geometrically exact (GE) beam theory, and the resulting nonlinear equations of motion were solved using FE technique. This problem has application to mineral sensing wherein large mineral sensors towed by helicopters are utilized.

Please feel free to <a href="#contactinfo" style="text-decoration:none">email</a> me, I would love to hear from you!

## Research

### Whipping cables

A flexible cable with no bending stiffness takes the shape of a catenary when its ends are held fixed between two supports. If one end of the cable is allowed to fall vertically under gravity while holding the other end fixed, the potential energy would transform partially into the kinetic and the strain energies. We are analyzing the dynamics of the cable when the cable whips.

### Balloon tethers

While deploying a blimp into the atmosphere the tether holding it travels vertically (lengthens) from the base anchor. To study the dynamics and stability of this motion, the tether is modeled as a geometrically exact (GE) beam and the blimp as a rigid body. Our study shows how the stability of lengthening tether is affected by large initial perturbations and aerodynamic forces on the blimp.

### Towing cables 

The towing of a large, ring-shaped, underslung load attached by a heavy, flexible cable is investigated. For surveying large areas in less time, a large ring-shaped water/mineral detector is suspended from a helicopter with the help of a long cable. For optimal operation, the ring-shaped detector should be in the horizontal plane, i.e. normal to gravity. The helicopter’s motion and aerodynamic forces affect the motion of the cable and the detector. Further, these forces may misalign the detector or even destabilize it during operating conditions. The dynamics of the cable and detector together as a system is investigated during hovering, forward and maneuvered flight conditions. <a id="traveling"> </a>

### Traveling cables 

Traveling cables are fundamental driving mechanisms in elevators, conveyor belts, automobile chain-drives, cableways, etc. In these, all or part of the cable is inclined to gravity. During operations, the cable tends to oscillate transversely as it travels longitudinally. In this study, the cable is modeled as a linear elastic beam that resists bending moment and shear, and
as an inextensible string which supports only tension. The dynamics of horizontally traveling (traveling direction normal to gravity) beams and strings is well studied. We investigate the influence of gravity on the stability of beams and strings which travel vertically, against gravity. <a id="sloshing"> </a>

### Fuel sloshing 

Sloshing refers to the motion of a liquid inside a container. It may be caused by any disturbance of partially-filled liquid containers. This motion of the fluid is typically uncontrolled and hence affects the dynamics of the container in a non-trivial manner. Liquid propellants constitute the largest part of the total mass of many spacecrafts. Sloshing of liquid fuel in the fuel tanks affects the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft, specifically, its orientation and angular velocity. For example, in a partially-filled container, the oscillation of the liquid shifts the system’s center of mass. To understand this motion, we need to know how the oscillation of the fluid depends upon the motion of the container, forces acting on it and the shape of the container. An exact analytical understanding of sloshing is difficult, and even computations are not certainly straightforward. We approximate the motion of the fuel in its first mode by that of a spherical pendulum. The length and mass of the pendulum are related to the amount of fuel remaining, while the spacecraft is modeled as a rigid body. To compare with a lab-scale experiment we, in fact, take the spacecraft to be suspended from a point on the Earth’s surface. <a id="course"> </a>
