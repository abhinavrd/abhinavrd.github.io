  <p>Sloshing refers to the motion of a liquid inside a container. It may be caused by any disturbance of
    partially-filled
    liquid containers. This motion of the fluid is typically uncontrolled and hence affects the dynamics of the
    container in a
    non-trivial manner. Liquid propellants constitute the largest part of the total mass of many spacecrafts. Sloshing
    of
    liquid fuel in the fuel tanks affects the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft, specifically, its orientation and
    angular
    velocity. For example, in a partially-filled container, the oscillation of the liquid shifts the system’s center of
    mass.
    To understand this motion, we need to know how the oscillation of the fluid depends upon the motion of the
    container,
    forces acting on it and the shape of the container. An exact analytical understanding of sloshing is difficult, and
    even
    computations are not certainly straightforward. We approximate the motion of the fuel in its first mode by that of a
    spherical pendulum. The length and mass of the pendulum are related to the amount of fuel remaining, while the
    spacecraft
    is modeled as a rigid body. To compare with a lab-scale experiment we, in fact, take the spacecraft to be suspended
    from a
    point on the Earth’s surface. <a id="course"> </a></p>
